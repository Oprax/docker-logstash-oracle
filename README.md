This is an Automated Build Docker image created from `logstash:latest` that includes the `logstash-jdbc-plugin`, Oracle InstantClient, and some `.jars` inside the container for use in your logstash `.conf` files.

You can use this image the same way you would use the  [logstash](http://hub.docker.com/_/logstash) official image.
